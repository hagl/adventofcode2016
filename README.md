Solving AoC 2016 in the nix programming languages

I used this as an opportunity to learn the nix programming language and to see how well it works as a 'general purpose' language.

# Running the code
The src directory contains a day[0-9]\*.nix file for each day, to run it use

```
nix-instantiate --eval --strict src/day3.nix
```
